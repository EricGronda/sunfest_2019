# Sourcing and Set-up

To set up the scripts in this program, you first need to source the set-up file. Consider adding this line to the bottom of your ```.bashrc``` file so that you do not need to source the file on every startup:

```
source tools/setup.bash
```

# DAVIS Script

The script used to run the DAVIS camera operates based on ROS and TMUX. This script is entirely optional but simplifies usage of the camera.

You can find this file and more information about it under ```../tools/davis```
